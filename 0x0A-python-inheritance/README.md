# Python Inheritance
Inheritance in python programming can be defined as a feature in which a particular class passed the qualities of its base class. It can be well explaned using this code section
```
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>
```
The `DerivedClassName` takes on the qualities of the `BaseClassName`. By qualities, I mean the methods and attributes
